Capstone-Stock-Analysis Coursera Capstone Project: My first stock analysis tool with Python
With download_SP500_timeseries_capstone.py the stock symbols and basic company information are downloaded from Wikipedia: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies 
For further use the data are stored in SP500.csv

Using the stock symbols the timeseries of the last 20 years of the stock data are downloaded using ALPHA_VANTAGE, which is free. 
For each symbol a separate csv file containting, e.g. 'Close' data are created. 
I am using the free version and have a limitation of downloads per minute. 
To download all the stock date for S&P500 I included a waiting loop to overcome this problem. 
You have to start the routine and let it run for a couple of minutes until you get all the data. 
The downloaded files can be used for further analysis.
I also tried other sources, e.g. iexfinance. 
I did not want to pay money and reached quite soon the limitation for downloading data and I decided to used https://www.alphavantage.co/.
AnalysisSP500_capstone.py is reading all the time series of all SP500 stocks and certain values are calculated. This is much quicker than the first routine because I did not need a waiting loop. The values are stored 'Analysis.csv' and can be used for quick selection of stocks.
AnalysisSP500_2.py is selection certain stocks depending on criteria, e.g. moving average. 

The time series of the selected stocks together with some basic company information are printed.
The shown plots and information can support buying and selling decisions - or you just get a better understanding what's happening in the marked.
